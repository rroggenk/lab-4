# Transforming a Static Dashboard into an Interactive Dashboard"

For this lab assignment, you are tasked with transforming your previous static
dashboard into an interactive dashboard using either Shiny or webR. 

## Dashboard Requirements

The dashboard you create **must** have the following:

- at least one opportunity for user input via a slide bar
- at least one opportunity for user input via check boxes 

These interactive features are expected to be used to:

- update at least one visualization
- update at least one of your "quick information" cards

*Note: You are free to swap one of your visualizations out for an interactive table!*

## Submission

You are required to submit **both** the link to your GitHub repository 
containing your source code **and** a link to your [published]{.underline}
dashboard. You are expected to publish your dashboard through

publishing service for static content created with Quarto.
